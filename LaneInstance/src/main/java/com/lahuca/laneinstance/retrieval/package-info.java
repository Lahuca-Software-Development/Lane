/**
 * This package contains classes that are retrieved by the controller, which allows it to make it easier to work upon.
 * This allows the instance to also work on objects from other instances by using better object-oriented functions.
 * Only at the time of retrieval, the requested information is actually up to date.
 * When running any operations on the retrieved data, this is done on the controller.
